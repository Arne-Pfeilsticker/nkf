[Run it!](http://curran.github.io/chiasm/kitchenSink)

This is a "kitchen sink" demo of Chiasm. It contains various configurations that are loaded at runtime, showing Chiasm plugins and how they can be used. This program serves as a visual counterpart to the mocha unit tests. This should grow and evolve to continuously showcase all available features of Chiasm and its built-in plugins.

Press any key to stop the automated configuration changes. Use left and right arrows to navigate between configurations, or select a configuration from the dropdown menu.
